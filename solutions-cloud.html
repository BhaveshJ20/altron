                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">In the past, many organisations would run business critical systems on their
                    own hardware or in their company data centre. The shift to a digital approach, however, means that
                    this is no longer necessary. Gone are the days of companies struggling with unreliable or
                    unavailable systems, or with ageing hardware. In an era of shrinking budgets and
                    increasingly-costly-to-replace hardware, the opportunities presented by the cloud are too big to
                    ignore.</p>
                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Among these are lower total cost of ownership, more rapid deployments, improved
                    security, elasticity in terms of performance and storage, compliance with local and global data
                    regulations (GDPR + POPI), faster upgrades and updates, a reduced strain on internal IT resources
                    and disaster recovery and uptime that is well over 99%.</p>
                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Altron Karabina is able to help you transform your business by seizing the
                    opportunities presented by the cloud, through the implementation of Microsoft Azure, it&rsquo;s
                    services and capabilities. We can create a cloud strategy that makes business sense, backed up by a
                    robust Cloud Governance Framework that will guide you in adopting, governing and securing the cloud
                    - whether this be in an application development scenario or the adoption of cloud infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Furthermore, we will help your business to decide on the best way to put your
                    cloud strategy in place. This includes providing a complete view of workloads that can be moved to
                    the cloud; a cost analysis to fully understand both current spend and future spend; and the ability
                    to migrate even the most complex workloads to the Azure cloud without any downtime, disruption of
                    service or data loss, in a cost effective and methodical way.</p>
                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">We also offer a Cloud Managed Service that turbo-charges single or multi-cloud
                    environments, deliver modern applications that can be easily and cost-effectively built, maintained
                    and designed in a manner to allow them to be able to meet changing business needs and requirements
                    in the future, and can assist with system-to-system integrations by leveraging Microsoft Azure-based
                    technologies.</p>
                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">We will help you from the assessment phase, through the development of a
                    migration plan, the actual migration itself, and on to the validation stage, where we ensure your
                    apps are all working, following the migration. Finally, we assist with optimisation, where we
                    undertake continuous cloud health monitoring to maximise performance and cut costs.</p>

                    transform and enable your core customers, employees, and business activities.</p>
                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">By integrating the data, business logic, and processes of your company&rsquo;s
                    CRM and ERP capabilities, Dynamics 365 eliminates silos and instead offers automated, integrated,
                    and intelligent sales and marketing capabilities that efficiently connect, prioritise, and convert
                    leads into paying customers.</p>

                    are required.</p>
                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Dynamics 365 allows your business to create impact faster and deliver more

                    enable your teams to accelerate results. Furthermore, because it uses modular, pre-built
                    applications, you can easily connect Dynamics 365 applications with the systems and tools you
                    already use to add to and extend your capabilities. It also ensures that you can connect solutions
                    end-to-end, thereby accelerating your business growth with connected business applications, which
