                                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Volume - this is the BIG in Big Data, and it is only growing
                                    bigger all the time. Bigger usually means more expensive hence optimizing costs and
                                    matching cost with business value is key.</p>

                                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Velocity - the principle of how quickly data is generated and
                                    consumed. More sophisticated technologies require more sophisticated processes and
                                    decision-makers. Ensuring that your business can keep up with the pace of
                                    information is more than a technology problem to solve.</p>
                                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Variety - Big Data comes from many sources, including
                                    enterprise systems, social media, and smart devices. Managing variety is not a
                                    one-size-fits all solution and will probably have different solutions tomorrow.
                                    Crafting an investment strategy to capture the value without resultant technical
                                    debt is key to a successful solution architecture.</p>
                                <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Veracity - Big Data must be truthful and accurate. Industry
                                    experience has shown that most Data Lakes become Data Swamps that add little to no
                                    value. Avoiding this outcome requites a clear strategy.</p>
