                            <p class="text-white-color sm-text text-center">It is a known fact that cyber-criminals are
                                often able to break into secure environments by using social engineering techniques and
                                employees' personal information shared on social media. It is for this reason we
                                recommend biometric identification, as this delivers a far higher degree of security
                                than manual processes such as passwords, e-mail addresses or personal identity numbers
                                (PINs). Because biometrics utilise an individual's unique characteristics, such as
                                fingerprints and voice, they not only offer robust security, but also free users from
                                the problems of remembering passwords and PINs.</p>

                                authentication solutions are able to curb fraud resulting from identity theft and
                                misrepresentation, by supplying end-to-end biometric identity and access management
                                hardware, along with software and consulting solutions that meet the needs for biometric
                                enrolment, authentication and verification. Our reputation in this arena is such that we
                                are a trusted partner to the Top five banks, as well as to both government and several

                                need to stay on top of the joiners, movers and leavers of your workforce. Identifying
                                users and managing their access is ‘mission critical’ for Identity Security – because
                                movers or leavers often cause scattered access legacies, entitlement creep or worse. We
                                provide an Identity Governance solution that ensures that each of your employees has the

                                        the cloud and now being accessed via the Internet, rather than a corporate
                                        network, it no longer makes sense to run security in a traditional, hosted,
                                        on-premise, centrally controlled way. This is the point where cyber-security
                                        intersects with the rise of the cloud. </p>
                                    <p class="sm-text lh-xl">To solve the challenges created by this shift, Altron has
                                        implemented a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), where security services have
                                        been moved into the cloud and are now offered as a service. This brings security
                                        closer to both users and their applications and services - by placing it at the
                                        edge - and gives organisations the operational and budgetary agility and
                                        scalability to navigate changing circumstances, such as the switch to remote
                                        working.</p>
                                    <p class="sm-text lh-xl">With a SASE approach, your security controls live in the
                                        cloud and users access the SASE-based cloud security solution via the Internet,
                                        enabling it to act as a secure conduit to the rest of the world.</p>
                                    <p class="sm-text lh-xl">Altron also offers cloud-based solution for ID & bank card
                                        issuance that sits at the Edge, known as Identity as a service (IDAAS). This
                                        provides simultaneous physical and digital card issuance solutions to various
                                        market verticals, including Financial, Government, Retail, Loyalty, Healthcare
                                        and Access Control. IDaaS allows for the in-branch issuance of personalised
                                        debit and credit cards for certain financial services sector organisations.
